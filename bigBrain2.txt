🧠 Task Group: Hero Workflows & Capabilities
Goal: Implement three high-level capabilities + workflows in Agent Cortex using existing RAD, Cortex, and Toolkit infrastructure.


Add new capabilities to capability_registry:


rad_repo_refactor_and_migration


bootstrap_agent_cortex


incident_root_cause_and_fix


Use the structures and fields described above (capability_key, title, description, preferred_workflows, preferred_tools, default_agent_tier, risk_level, tags).




Add corresponding workflow definitions to tool_workflows:


rad_index_repo, rad_refactor_plan, rad_refactor_execute


rad_index_all_sources, cortex_extract_patterns, cortex_generate_handbook


incident_triage, incident_fix, incident_lesson


Each workflow should be represented as JSON steps referencing:


Robinson’s Toolkit tools (RAD category + system category),


Free/Paid Agent tools (free_agent_run_task_v2, paid_agent_run_task_v2, batch tools),


Thinking Tools MCP (blue_team, red_team, decision_matrix),


Cortex APIs where appropriate.






Ensure Agent Core can execute these workflows:


Integrate the new workflows into the existing workflow/executor layer (from Credit Optimizer migration), so that:


When a capability is selected, the associated workflows can be executed step-by-step by the Agent Core.







🧭 Task Group: System Introspection Tools (Robinson’s Toolkit)
Goal: Give agents tool-level access to system meta-knowledge.


Add a new system category to robinsons-toolkit-mcp with tools:


system_get_tool_catalog


Returns a grouped list of all tools across connected MCP servers.




system_get_capabilities


Queries capability_registry and returns summaries.




system_get_agent_handbook


Reads the latest “Agent Handbook” artifact from Cortex/RAD; if missing, responds with a clear “needs creation” signal.




Optionally, system_get_architecture_overview


Returns a short, curated system architecture overview.






Implement these tools using:


Existing DB connections (for capability & handbook lookups).


Existing MCP metadata (for tool catalog).





📚 Task Group: Agent Handbook & Evidence Integration
Goal: Ensure every complex task gets system-level context.


Create or update Agent Cortex functions to:


Store the Agent Handbook as a knowledge_artifacts row with artifact_type = 'agent_handbook' and tags ['handbook','system_overview'].




Update gatherEvidence() in Agent Core to:


Always attempt to retrieve the Agent Handbook artifact (directly or via system_get_agent_handbook).


Attach it to the EvidenceBundle for tasks that are:


long-running,


high-risk,


or explicitly meta/system-related.







🔁 Task Group: Self-Orientation Workflow
Goal: Provide a reusable “orient yourself” workflow.


Define a tool_workflows entry named system_self_orientation that:


Calls:


system_get_tool_catalog


system_get_capabilities


system_get_agent_handbook




Produces an orientation summary as a knowledge_artifacts row for that task/session.




Expose a simple MCP tool in Free and Paid Agent MCPs:


agent_self_orient


Which triggers the system_self_orientation workflow and returns the orientation summary.





With these in place:


Your agents won’t just have a Cortex, RAD Crawler, and Toolkit—they’ll know they have them, know what they can do, and have explicit workflows that tie it all together.


From day one, you’ll be able to say things like:


“Index this repo and plan a safe migration using what you find.”


“Bootstrap your own brain from my code and docs.”


“Investigate this incident, fix it, and update your memory so you don’t repeat it.”




…and the system will have the hooks, workflows, and meta-knowledge to actually do it.



🧠 Task Group: Global Knowledge Pack – Schema Hooks

Goal: Allow Cortex entries to be tagged as “global” (non-repo-specific) vs repo/task-specific.

In each Cortex table (thinking_playbooks, tool_workflows, code_patterns, capability_registry, knowledge_artifacts), add:

scope VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'global' CHECK (scope IN ('global','repo','task'));

scope_repo_id VARCHAR(255) NULL;

Use:

scope = 'global' for initial knowledge pack entries.

scope = 'repo' or 'task' for entries learned from specific repos or tasks later.

📚 Task Group: Seed Knowledge Artifacts (Guides & Checklists)

Goal: Create and insert high-value guides and checklists as knowledge_artifacts with scope = 'global'.

For each of these topics, use the Paid Agent (with web research tools where appropriate) to generate a thorough but concise guide:

SaaS Multitenancy Patterns

Production-Ready Node/TS & Python Checklist

Effective Web Research for Agents

Designing & Evolving REST APIs

Basic Service Observability (logging, metrics, tracing)

For each topic:

Store final text in knowledge_artifacts with:

artifact_type = 'guide' (for the guides),

artifact_type = 'checklist' (for checklists),

scope = 'global',

tags like ['saas','multitenancy'], ['web_research'], etc.

Document the process in docs/GLOBAL_KNOWLEDGE_PACK.md:

Which topics were created.

Which artifact IDs correspond to them.

🧩 Task Group: Seed Generic Thinking Playbooks

Goal: Pre-populate thinking_playbooks with robust playbooks for core dev activities.

Create at least these playbooks:

playbook_debug_complex_bug

playbook_design_saas_feature

playbook_refactor_large_component

playbook_research_unknown_tech

For each playbook:

Fill trigger_query with:

task_kinds, keywords, and tags.

Fill tool_chain with appropriate thinking tools:

Debugging: ["root_cause_analysis","blue_team","red_team","decision_matrix"]

SaaS design: ["systems_thinking","blue_team","tradeoff_analysis","decision_matrix"]

Research: ["blue_team","source_triage","synthesis"] (you can map source_triage & synthesis to existing thinking tools or implement them as new ones).

Add notes_for_agent with clear bullet-point instructions on how to use the chain.

Set scope = 'global'.

🛠️ Task Group: Seed Generic Tool Workflows

Goal: Pre-populate tool_workflows with reusable dev workflows (independent of a specific repo).

Seed workflows:

workflow_create_saas_feature

workflow_setup_multitenant_db

workflow_effective_web_research

workflow_review_api_design

Each workflow’s steps should:

Reference:

Free / Paid Agent tools (*_run_task_v2, batch tools),

Thinking Tools MCP,

Robinson’s Toolkit (for repo introspection, DB/Neon integration, etc.).

Include placeholders ({{repo_id}}, {{feature_description}}) where Agent Core can fill in values from tasks.

Set min_agent_tier appropriately:

E.g., workflow_create_saas_feature can be any.

workflow_effective_web_research likely uses Paid Agent for bigger syntheses.

Set scope = 'global'.

💻 Task Group: Seed Generic Code Patterns

Goal: Pre-populate code_patterns with language- and context-specific templates.

Seed patterns for:

language = 'typescript', context = 'mcp-handler'

language = 'typescript', context = 'toolkit-category'

language = 'typescript', context = 'saas-api-route'

language = 'python', context = 'background-worker'

For each code pattern:

Include:

a fully working code snippet (minimal but production-quality),

explanation (what it does, how to adapt),

style_notes (error handling, logging, naming).

Tags like ['mcp','handler'], ['saas','multitenancy'], etc.

scope = 'global'.

Use your actual current codebase style (import paths, logging conventions, etc.) so patterns match how you want to write code.

🧩 Task Group: Seed Capabilities

Goal: Give the system high-level “skills” that map to the knowledge you just seeded.

Add capabilities:

design_saas_feature

implement_multitenant_support

review_security_of_endpoint

perform_deep_web_research_on_topic

For each:

Link to relevant:

thinking_playbooks,

tool_workflows,

code_patterns,

knowledge_artifacts.

Mark scope = 'global'.

Ensure system_get_capabilities (in Robinson’s Toolkit) can filter and return these capabilities to the agents.

🔧 Task Group: Global Knowledge Bootstrap Workflow

Goal: Wrap the above seeding process into a single workflow, so you can re-run or extend it later.

Add a tool_workflows entry named bootstrap_global_knowledge_pack:

Steps:

Create global guides/checklists (if missing).

Insert global playbooks (if missing).

Insert global workflows (if missing).

Insert global code patterns (if missing).

Insert global capabilities (if missing).

Each step can call internal Cortex/DB functions or use Paid Agent to (re)generate content if needed.

Expose a small MCP tool on Paid Agent:

paid_agent_bootstrap_global_knowledge

Implementation:

Trigger bootstrap_global_knowledge_pack workflow.

Return summary of what was seeded/updated.

4. How agents use this from day one

Once this is seeded:

On every task, Agent Core:

Calls gatherEvidence() (RAD + docs + handbook), plus:

getCortexContext() which now returns:

global playbooks, workflows, patterns, capabilities, and guides that match the task.

So if you say:

“Design a multi-tenant SaaS onboarding flow and implement the backend & frontend.”

The pipeline roughly becomes:

Cortex matches:

capability: design_saas_feature, implement_multitenant_support;

playbook: playbook_design_saas_feature;

workflows: workflow_create_saas_feature, workflow_setup_multitenant_db;

artifacts: “SaaS Multitenancy Patterns”, “Production-Ready Node/TS Checklist”;

code patterns: SaaS API, MCP/Toolkit patterns.

Thinking Tools:

Use the SaaS playbook to structure reasoning (tradeoffs, patterns).

Execution:

Use workflows to:

inspect repo,

update DB schema,

implement endpoints/page,

run tests.

Use code patterns as templates.

Learning:

RAD records new tasks/decisions/lessons.

Cortex adds new artifacts as you solve real problems.

So you don’t have a blank-slate LLM; you have an agent stepping into a pre-stocked library of skills & patterns, tuned for your stack and your system.


🧠 Task: Global Knowledge Pack v2 – New Domains

Goal: Extend Agent Cortex’s global knowledge with new domains: web design, OAuth/auth, automation & n8n, AI/LLMs & agents, custom GPTs, VS Code extensions, AI wrappers.

Document artifact IDs and topics in docs/GLOBAL_KNOWLEDGE_PACK_V2.md.

2) Seed new thinking_playbooks (global)

Insert at least these playbooks into thinking_playbooks with scope = 'global':

playbook_design_saas_feature

playbook_debug_complex_bug

playbook_research_unknown_tech

playbook_add_rag_to_app

playbook_design_new_agent

playbook_wrap_new_llm_provider

Each playbook should:

Define trigger_query (keywords, task kinds).

Define tool_chain using existing Thinking Tools (e.g. blue_team, red_team, decision_matrix, systems_thinking).

Include notes_for_agent that reference relevant guides/checklists from knowledge_artifacts seeded in step 1.

3) Seed new tool_workflows (global)

Insert global workflows into tool_workflows (JSON steps referencing existing MCP tools + Agent Core tools):

workflow_create_saas_feature

workflow_setup_multitenant_db

workflow_effective_web_research

workflow_use_n8n_for_long_running_tasks

workflow_design_and_implement_new_agent

workflow_wrap_new_llm_provider

Each workflow should:

Be provider-agnostic where possible but able to choose Free vs Paid Agents as needed.

Use Thinking Tools for planning.

Use Robinson’s Toolkit (and n8n tools if present) for automation steps.

4) Seed new code_patterns (global)

Add patterns into code_patterns with scope = 'global' for:

Web/UI:

typescript + context = 'nextjs_page_with_api_integration'

typescript + context = 'react_form_with_validation'

Auth:

typescript + context = 'oauth_login_handler'

typescript + context = 'oauth_callback_handler_with_pkce'

typescript + context = 'auth_middleware_multi_tenant'

VS Code:

typescript + context = 'vscode_command_extension'

typescript + context = 'vscode_webview_panel'

typescript + context = 'vscode_agent_control_panel'

AI Wrappers:

typescript + context = 'llm_provider_wrapper'

typescript + context = 'tool_calling_orchestration'

Each pattern must include:

A minimal but production-quality snippet aligned with existing project style.

An explanation of when/how to use it.

Style notes (logging, error-handling, naming).

5) Seed new capability_registry entries

Add capabilities with scope = 'global':

design_saas_feature

implement_multitenant_support

implement_secure_oauth_login

design_and_build_responsive_web_ui

perform_deep_web_research_on_topic

design_custom_gpts_for_workflow

design_and_build_vscode_extension_for_agent_control

integrate_new_llm_provider

design_ai_wrapper_for_feature

Each capability should:

Reference relevant playbooks, workflows, patterns, and knowledge artifacts by ID or stable name in the metadata field.

Set reasonable default_agent_tier (e.g. paid for security reviews or big research, any for basic coding tasks).

Once Augment has done this, your Free and Paid agents will boot up with:

A library of expert guides/checklists,

A set of thinking playbooks for hard problems,

Executable workflows for typical dev/ops/AI tasks,

Code patterns for high-quality implementations,

And capabilities that tell them “here’s what I’m good at and how to do it”.
