🧠 Task Group: Hero Workflows & Capabilities
Goal: Implement three high-level capabilities + workflows in Agent Cortex using existing RAD, Cortex, and Toolkit infrastructure.


Add new capabilities to capability_registry:


rad_repo_refactor_and_migration


bootstrap_agent_cortex


incident_root_cause_and_fix


Use the structures and fields described above (capability_key, title, description, preferred_workflows, preferred_tools, default_agent_tier, risk_level, tags).




Add corresponding workflow definitions to tool_workflows:


rad_index_repo, rad_refactor_plan, rad_refactor_execute


rad_index_all_sources, cortex_extract_patterns, cortex_generate_handbook


incident_triage, incident_fix, incident_lesson


Each workflow should be represented as JSON steps referencing:


Robinson’s Toolkit tools (RAD category + system category),


Free/Paid Agent tools (free_agent_run_task_v2, paid_agent_run_task_v2, batch tools),


Thinking Tools MCP (blue_team, red_team, decision_matrix),


Cortex APIs where appropriate.






Ensure Agent Core can execute these workflows:


Integrate the new workflows into the existing workflow/executor layer (from Credit Optimizer migration), so that:


When a capability is selected, the associated workflows can be executed step-by-step by the Agent Core.







🧭 Task Group: System Introspection Tools (Robinson’s Toolkit)
Goal: Give agents tool-level access to system meta-knowledge.


Add a new system category to robinsons-toolkit-mcp with tools:


system_get_tool_catalog


Returns a grouped list of all tools across connected MCP servers.




system_get_capabilities


Queries capability_registry and returns summaries.




system_get_agent_handbook


Reads the latest “Agent Handbook” artifact from Cortex/RAD; if missing, responds with a clear “needs creation” signal.




Optionally, system_get_architecture_overview


Returns a short, curated system architecture overview.






Implement these tools using:


Existing DB connections (for capability & handbook lookups).


Existing MCP metadata (for tool catalog).





📚 Task Group: Agent Handbook & Evidence Integration
Goal: Ensure every complex task gets system-level context.


Create or update Agent Cortex functions to:


Store the Agent Handbook as a knowledge_artifacts row with artifact_type = 'agent_handbook' and tags ['handbook','system_overview'].




Update gatherEvidence() in Agent Core to:


Always attempt to retrieve the Agent Handbook artifact (directly or via system_get_agent_handbook).


Attach it to the EvidenceBundle for tasks that are:


long-running,


high-risk,


or explicitly meta/system-related.







🔁 Task Group: Self-Orientation Workflow
Goal: Provide a reusable “orient yourself” workflow.


Define a tool_workflows entry named system_self_orientation that:


Calls:


system_get_tool_catalog


system_get_capabilities


system_get_agent_handbook




Produces an orientation summary as a knowledge_artifacts row for that task/session.




Expose a simple MCP tool in Free and Paid Agent MCPs:


agent_self_orient


Which triggers the system_self_orientation workflow and returns the orientation summary.





With these in place:


Your agents won’t just have a Cortex, RAD Crawler, and Toolkit—they’ll know they have them, know what they can do, and have explicit workflows that tie it all together.


From day one, you’ll be able to say things like:


“Index this repo and plan a safe migration using what you find.”


“Bootstrap your own brain from my code and docs.”


“Investigate this incident, fix it, and update your memory so you don’t repeat it.”




…and the system will have the hooks, workflows, and meta-knowledge to actually do it.
