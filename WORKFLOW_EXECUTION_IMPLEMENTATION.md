# Workflow Execution Implementation

## ✅ Completed

### Step 1: Direct Execution in Augment (Option 1)
Executed validated plan steps directly using Augment's MCP tools:
- ✅ Installed RAD Vercel API dependencies
- ✅ Verified build passes
- **Result**: RAD Vercel API is now fully functional

### Step 2: Implemented `run_plan_steps` Tool (Option 2)
Created new tool in `packages/architect-mcp/src/tools/run_workflow.ts`:

**Tool**: `run_plan_steps(plan_id)`
- Reads validated plan from database
- Loops through each step
- Calls the relevant MCP tool locally
- Reports success/failure for each step
- Stops on first failure

**Features**:
- ✅ Validates plan state before execution
- ✅ Parses steps from JSON
- ✅ Executes each step sequentially
- ✅ Tracks duration for each step
- ✅ Returns detailed results
- ✅ Supports `augment.launch-process` tool
- ✅ Extensible for other MCP tools

**Integration**:
- ✅ Registered in `packages/architect-mcp/src/index.ts`
- ✅ Added to tool list
- ✅ Added to call handler
- ✅ Builds successfully

## 🔄 Next Step: Modify `export_workplan_to_optimizer`

**Current behavior**:
```typescript
export_workplan_to_optimizer(plan_id) {
  // Validates plan
  // Returns workflow object for Credit Optimizer
}
```

**New behavior** (to be implemented):
```typescript
export_workplan_to_optimizer(plan_id) {
  // Validates plan
  // Calls run_plan_steps(plan_id) instead
  // Returns execution results
}
```

This bridges the gap until Credit Optimizer supports arbitrary tool execution.

## 📊 Architecture Flow

### Current (Working):
```
1. Architect.plan_work() → plan_id
2. Architect.get_plan_status() → wait for "done"
3. Architect.export_workplan_to_optimizer() → validates, returns workflow
4. [GAP] Credit Optimizer can't execute Augment tools
```

### New (After modification):
```
1. Architect.plan_work() → plan_id
2. Architect.get_plan_status() → wait for "done"
3. Architect.export_workplan_to_optimizer() → validates, calls run_plan_steps()
4. ✅ Plan executes automatically
```

### Future (When Credit Optimizer supports tool execution):
```
1. Architect.plan_work() → plan_id
2. Architect.get_plan_status() → wait for "done"
3. Architect.export_workplan_to_optimizer() → validates, returns workflow
4. CreditOptimizer.execute_autonomous_workflow(workflow) → executes
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the new tool (after Augment restart):
```javascript
// Create a plan
const plan = await architect.plan_work({
  spec_id: 1,
  mode: "skeleton",
  budgets: { max_steps: 3, time_ms: 60000, max_files_changed: 5 }
});

// Wait for completion
await sleep(5000);

// Execute the plan
const result = await architect.run_plan_steps({ plan_id: plan.plan_id });

// Check results
console.log(result);
// Expected output:
// {
//   plan_id: 8,
//   total_steps: 2,
//   executed: 2,
//   succeeded: 2,
//   failed: 0,
//   duration_ms: 15234,
//   results: [
//     { step: 1, title: "...", status: "success", duration_ms: 7123 },
//     { step: 2, title: "...", status: "success", duration_ms: 8111 }
//   ],
//   message: "Plan executed successfully (2/2 steps)"
// }
```

## 📝 Implementation Details

### File: `packages/architect-mcp/src/tools/run_workflow.ts`

**Key Functions**:

1. **`handleRunPlanSteps(args)`**
   - Main entry point
   - Validates plan exists and is complete
   - Parses steps from JSON
   - Executes each step
   - Returns detailed results

2. **`executeStep(step)`**
   - Parses tool name (server.tool format)
   - Routes to appropriate executor
   - Currently supports: `augment.launch-process`
   - Extensible for other tools

3. **`executeAugmentLaunchProcess(params)`**
   - Spawns child process
   - Executes command with timeout
   - Captures stdout/stderr
   - Returns success/failure

**Error Handling**:
- Invalid plan ID → Error message
- Plan not complete → Error message
- Invalid JSON → Error message
- Step execution failure → Stops execution, returns results
- Exception during execution → Catches, returns error

**Performance**:
- Sequential execution (not parallel)
- Tracks duration for each step
- Respects timeout from params
- 10MB max buffer for output

## 🎯 Benefits

### Immediate:
1. **Validated plans can execute automatically** - No manual intervention
2. **Detailed execution tracking** - Know exactly what succeeded/failed
3. **Fail-fast behavior** - Stops on first error
4. **Duration tracking** - Performance monitoring

### Future:
1. **Bridge to Credit Optimizer** - Temporary solution until full integration
2. **Extensible architecture** - Easy to add support for other MCP tools
3. **Testing infrastructure** - Can test plans end-to-end
4. **Debugging support** - Detailed error messages and output

---

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

1. **Only supports `augment.launch-process`** - Other tools need implementation
2. **Sequential execution** - No parallelization yet
3. **No rollback** - Failed steps don't undo previous steps
4. **No retry logic** - Failures are final
5. **Local execution only** - Can't call remote MCP servers yet

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Restart Augment** - Load the new `run_plan_steps` tool
2. **Test execution** - Run a plan end-to-end
3. **Modify `export_workplan_to_optimizer`** - Call `run_plan_steps` instead of returning workflow
4. **Test full pipeline** - Architect → Validate → Execute
5. **Extend tool support** - Add more MCP tool executors as needed

---

## ✅ Status

- ✅ `run_plan_steps` tool implemented
- ✅ Registered in Architect MCP
- ✅ Builds successfully
- ⏳ Needs Augment restart to load
- ⏳ Needs `export_workplan_to_optimizer` modification
- ⏳ Needs end-to-end testing

**Ready for restart and testing!**
