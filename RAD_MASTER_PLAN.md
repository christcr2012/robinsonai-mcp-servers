## Execution Strategy

### Use 4-Server Orchestration

For each phase:

```javascript
// 1. Plan with Architect
const plan = await architect.plan_work({
  goal: "Complete RAD Phase 1: Neon Schema Deployment with safety limits",
  depth: "fast",
  budgets: { 
    max_steps: 12, 
    time_ms: 480000,  // 8 minutes (won't timeout)
    max_files_changed: 5 
  }
});

// 2. Export to Optimizer
const workflow = await architect.export_workplan_to_optimizer({ 
  plan_id: plan.plan_id 
});

// 3. Execute autonomously
await creditOptimizer.execute_autonomous_workflow(workflow);
```

### Phase Execution Order

1. **Phase 1** → Deploy schema, verify, test
2. **Phase 2** → Build API, add caching/batching/hybrid search, test
3. **Phase 3** → Add advanced features, comprehensive testing
4. **Phase 4** → Final features, complete documentation

**Each phase is independent** - can pause between phases if needed.

**Architecture:**
```
Single Neon Database (Shared "Treasure Trove"):
├─ Web content (crawled docs)
├─ Repo content (code, README files)
├─ Agent logs (Architect plans, Autonomous Agent code, etc.)
├─ Agent conversations (full chat history)
├─ Agent decisions (what worked, what didn't)

└─ Failed Tasks (retry queue)

Workflow:
1. Architect creates work plan → pushes tasks to Redis queue
2. Agents pull tasks from queue (atomic claim)
3. Agent works on task, updates heartbeat
4. Agent completes task → pushes result to Redis
5. Other agents see completed work, avoid duplication
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Distributed task queue (multiple agents, no conflicts)
- ✅ Atomic task claiming (only one agent per task)
- ✅ Heartbeat monitoring (detect stuck agents)
- ✅ Task priority (important tasks first)
- ✅ Multiple RAD crawlers can run simultaneously
- ✅ Uses existing Redis MCP (80 tools already built)

**Use Cases:**
- Multiple RAD crawlers indexing different sites simultaneously

**Architecture:**
```
Learning System:
├─ SQLite (Local, Fast Writes)
