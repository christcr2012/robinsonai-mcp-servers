# Definition of Done (Repo-Enforced)

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30  
**Status:** ACTIVE - All agents MUST comply

---

## üéØ Core Principle

**NO CODE SHIPS UNTIL IT PASSES ALL CHECKS**

This is not optional. This is not negotiable. Every agent, every task, every commit.

---

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done Checklist

### 1. NO PLACEHOLDERS OR STUBS ‚ùå

**FORBIDDEN:**
- `TODO`
- `FIXME`
- `PLACEHOLDER`
- `STUB`
- `MOCK` (in production code)
- `TBD`
- `// implement this later`
- `throw new Error('Not implemented')`
- Empty function bodies
- Commented-out fake code

**REQUIRED:**
- Real, working implementations
- If a dependency is missing, CREATE IT
- If you can't implement it, ADJUST THE SPEC to remove it
- No excuses, no exceptions

### 2. CODE COMPILES ‚úÖ

**TypeScript:**
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```
Must exit with code 0. No errors, no warnings.

**JavaScript:**
```bash
node --check <file>
```
Must parse without syntax errors.

### 3. ACCEPTANCE CHECKS PASS ‚úÖ

Every task has a spec file in `.robinson/specs/<task-id>.md` with acceptance checks.

```bash
npm run accept .robinson/specs/<task-id>.md
```

Must exit with code 0. All checks green.

### 4. MINIMAL DOCUMENTATION ‚úÖ

**Required:**
- JSDoc/TSDoc for all exported functions
- Inline comments for complex logic
- README updates if adding new features

**NOT Required:**
- Verbose documentation
- Redundant comments
- Documentation for obvious code

### 5. NO SECRETS IN SOURCE ‚úÖ

**FORBIDDEN:**
- API keys in code
- Passwords in code
- Tokens in code
- Connection strings in code

**REQUIRED:**
- Use environment variables
- Use `.env` files (gitignored)
- Use secret management tools

### 6. TESTS (When Applicable) ‚úÖ

**Required for:**
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring critical code

**NOT Required for:**
- Documentation changes
- Configuration changes
- Simple one-liners

## üö´ What Happens If You Violate This

### Pre-Commit Hook
```bash
npm run qa
```

**If this fails:**
- ‚ùå Commit is BLOCKED
- ‚ùå You cannot push
- ‚ùå You must fix and retry

### CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
npm run qa && npm run accept
```

**If this fails:**
- ‚ùå PR is BLOCKED
- ‚ùå Merge is BLOCKED
- ‚ùå Deployment is BLOCKED

---

## üìã How to Use This

### For Agents

1. **Before writing code:**
   - Read the task spec in `.robinson/specs/<task-id>.md`
   - Understand the acceptance checks
   - Plan your implementation

2. **While writing code:**
   - NO placeholders
   - NO TODOs
   - Real implementations only

3. **After writing code:**
   ```bash
   npm run qa                                    # Check for placeholders, TS errors
   npm run accept .robinson/specs/<task-id>.md   # Run acceptance checks
   ```

4. **If checks fail:**
   - FIX the code
   - Re-run checks
   - Repeat until GREEN

5. **Only then:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: <description>"
   git push
   ```

### For Humans

Same process. No exceptions.

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

**A task is DONE when:**
- ‚úÖ No placeholders/stubs/TODOs
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compiles with 0 errors
- ‚úÖ All acceptance checks pass
- ‚úÖ Minimal documentation exists
- ‚úÖ No secrets in source
- ‚úÖ Tests pass (if applicable)
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hook passes
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline passes

**Until ALL of these are true, the task is NOT DONE.**

---

## üí° Philosophy

**"Ship working code, not promises."**

- Placeholders are promises
- TODOs are promises
- Stubs are promises
- We ship WORKING CODE

**"If you can't implement it, don't promise it."**

- Adjust the spec
- Remove the feature
- Ask for help
- But don't ship placeholders

**"The repo enforces quality, not humans."**

- Humans forget
- Humans get tired
- Humans make mistakes
- The repo never forgets

---

**This is the standard. Meet it or don't ship.**
