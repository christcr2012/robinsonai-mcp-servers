# Agent Rules (Hard Requirements)

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30  
**Audience:** ALL AI agents (Augment, Ollama, OpenAI, Claude, etc.)  
**Status:** MANDATORY

---

## üéØ Core Directive

**YOU ARE A PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE ENGINEER, NOT A PLACEHOLDER GENERATOR.**

Your job is to ship working code that compiles, runs, and passes tests. Not to write TODOs.

---

## üìã Hard Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)

### Rule #1: Read Local Conventions FIRST

**Before generating ANY code:**

1. Read `.robinson/policies/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`
2. Read `.robinson/policies/AGENT_RULES.md` (this file)
3. Read the task spec in `.robinson/specs/<task-id>.md`
4. Understand the acceptance checks
5. Plan your implementation

**DO NOT:**
- Skip reading conventions
- Assume you know the project structure
- Invent your own standards

### Rule #2: NO Placeholders, EVER

**FORBIDDEN:**
```typescript
// TODO: implement this
function doSomething() {
  throw new Error('Not implemented');
}
```

**REQUIRED:**
```typescript
function doSomething() {
  // Real implementation
  return actualWorkingCode();
}
```

**If you can't implement it:**
- Ask for clarification
- Adjust the spec to remove it
- Break it into smaller tasks
- But DO NOT ship a placeholder

### Rule #3: Extend Existing Layout

**DO NOT invent folders.**

**Existing structure:**
```
packages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ free-agent-mcp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paid-agent-mcp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ robinsons-toolkit-mcp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ thinking-tools-mcp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ credit-optimizer-mcp/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ openai-mcp/
```

**When adding new code:**
- Add to existing packages
- Follow existing patterns
- Match existing file structure

**DO NOT:**
- Create `packages/my-new-thing/` without approval
- Reorganize the entire repo
- Move files around randomly

### Rule #4: Run QA Before Committing

**ALWAYS run:**
```bash
npm run qa
```

**This checks:**
- No placeholders/TODOs/stubs
- TypeScript compiles
- No empty files

**If it fails:**
- FIX the code
- Re-run `npm run qa`
- Repeat until GREEN

**DO NOT:**
- Commit without running QA
- Ignore QA failures
- "Fix it later"

### Rule #5: Run Acceptance Checks

**ALWAYS run:**
```bash
npm run accept .robinson/specs/<task-id>.md
```

**This runs:**
- Task-specific acceptance checks
- Defined in the spec file
- Must ALL pass

**If it fails:**
- FIX the code
- Re-run acceptance checks
- Repeat until GREEN

**DO NOT:**
- Skip acceptance checks
- Assume it works
- "Test it manually later"

### Rule #6: Include Output in Response

**When you run commands, ALWAYS include:**
- The full command you ran
- The complete output
- The exit code

**Example:**
```
I ran: npm run qa
Exit code: 0
Output:
‚úÖ QA passed: no placeholders, TS ok.
```

**DO NOT:**
- Say "I ran the checks" without showing output
- Hide failures
- Summarize instead of showing full output

### Rule #7: Fix Until Green

**If checks fail:**

1. Read the error message
2. Understand what's wrong
3. Fix the code
4. Re-run the check
5. Repeat until GREEN

**DO NOT:**
- Give up after one try
- Ask the user to fix it
- Ship broken code

### Rule #8: Real Dependencies Only

**If your code needs a dependency:**

**OPTION A: Use existing dependency**
```typescript
import { existingFunction } from '../existing-module';
```

**OPTION B: Create the dependency**
```typescript
// Create the missing function
export function newFunction() {
  // Real implementation
}
```

**DO NOT:**
```typescript
// TODO: implement this dependency
import { nonExistentFunction } from '../fake-module';
```

### Rule #9: Respect the Spec

**The spec file (`.robinson/specs/<task-id>.md`) defines:**
- What to build
- Acceptance checks
- Success criteria

**Your job:**
- Build EXACTLY what the spec says
- Pass ALL acceptance checks
- Nothing more, nothing less

**DO NOT:**
- Add features not in the spec
- Skip features in the spec
- Reinterpret the spec

### Rule #10: No Excuses

**Common excuses we don't accept:**

‚ùå "I don't have enough context"  
‚úÖ Read the codebase, ask questions, use codebase-retrieval

‚ùå "This is too complex to implement"  
‚úÖ Break it into smaller tasks, ask for help, adjust the spec

‚ùå "I'll add a TODO and fix it later"  
‚úÖ Fix it NOW or remove the feature

‚ùå "The tests are failing but the code works"  
‚úÖ Fix the code until tests pass

‚ùå "I can't run the checks locally"  
‚úÖ Yes you can: `npm run qa` and `npm run accept`

## üîÑ Standard Workflow

### 1. Receive Task
```
User: "Add feature X"
```

### 2. Read Conventions
```bash
cat .robinson/policies/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
cat .robinson/policies/AGENT_RULES.md
cat .robinson/specs/<task-id>.md
```

### 3. Plan Implementation
```
- Feature X requires:
  - File A (new)
  - File B (modify)
  - Acceptance check: X works
```

### 4. Write Code
```typescript
// Real implementation, no placeholders
export function featureX() {
  return actualWorkingCode();
}
```

### 5. Run QA
```bash
npm run qa
# ‚úÖ QA passed: no placeholders, TS ok.
```

### 6. Run Acceptance
```bash
npm run accept .robinson/specs/feature-x.md
# ‚úÖ All checks passed
```

### 7. Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add feature X"
git push
```

### 8. Report
```
‚úÖ Feature X implemented
‚úÖ QA passed
‚úÖ Acceptance checks passed
‚úÖ Committed and pushed
```

## üö® What Happens If You Violate These Rules

### Immediate Consequences
- ‚ùå Pre-commit hook BLOCKS your commit
- ‚ùå CI/CD pipeline BLOCKS your PR
- ‚ùå Code review REJECTS your changes

### Long-term Consequences
- ‚ùå User loses trust in AI agents
- ‚ùå Manual review required for all changes
- ‚ùå Project velocity slows down

### The Goal
- ‚úÖ Ship working code every time
- ‚úÖ Build trust with the user
- ‚úÖ Increase autonomy over time

## üí° Remember

**You are not a TODO generator.**  
**You are not a placeholder factory.**  
**You are a professional software engineer.**

**Ship working code or don't ship at all.**

---

**These rules are non-negotiable. Follow them or your code will be rejected.**
