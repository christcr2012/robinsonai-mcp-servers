# Robinson's Toolkit - Debugging Steps

## Current Status
- ✅ Server works when run manually (shows 703 tools)
- ✅ Package is globally linked
- ✅ Build is current
- ✅ Google service account file is in correct location
- ❌ Augment shows 0 tools

## What We Need to Check

### 1. Is Augment even starting the server?

**In VS Code Developer Tools Console, look for:**
- Any errors mentioning "robinsons-toolkit"
- Any errors mentioning "mcp"
- Any startup messages

### 2. Check Augment Output Panel

1. Click `View` → `Output`
2. Select "Augment" or "MCP" from the dropdown
3. Look for any error messages

### 3. Check if the config is actually loaded

The config should be in Augment Settings. Can you:
1. Open Augment Settings
2. Go to MCP Servers section
3. **Take a screenshot** or **copy the JSON** you see there

### 4. Possible Issues

**Theory 1: Config not saved properly**
- Augment might not have saved the config
- Try exporting the config and checking if robinsons-toolkit is there

**Theory 2: Server crashing silently**
- The logging we added should show this
- But if it crashes before logging starts, we won't see it

**Theory 3: Augment using wrong command**
- Maybe it's not using the full path we specified
- Maybe it's trying to use the bare command which doesn't work

## Next Debugging Step

Please check the **Augment Output panel** (`View` → `Output` → select "Augment" or "MCP") and share what you see there.

Also, can you confirm the config in Augment Settings shows:
```json
"robinsons-toolkit-mcp": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["c:/Users/chris/Git Local/robinsonai-mcp-servers/packages/robinsons-toolkit-mcp/dist/index.js"],
  ...
}
```
