# PAID Agent Integration TODO

## 🎯 Purpose
Track all changes made to FREE agent that need to be replicated to PAID agent.
Once FREE agent is working perfectly, implement all these changes to PAID agent.

---

## ✅ Changes Made to FREE Agent (To Be Replicated)

### 1. Pipeline Integration
**What:** Integrated Synthesize-Execute-Critique-Refine pipeline into code generation

**FREE Agent Files Modified:**
- `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/agents/code-generator.ts`
  - Replaced direct Ollama calls with `iterateTask()` from pipeline
  - Added pipeline configuration (maxAttempts, acceptThreshold, minCoverage)
  - Converted PipelineResult to GenerateResult for backward compatibility

**PAID Agent Files to Modify:**
- `packages/paid-agent-mcp/src/agents/code-generator.ts` (or equivalent)
- Need to create provider-agnostic pipeline that works with:
  - OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, o1-mini)
  - Claude (haiku, sonnet, opus)
  - Ollama (fallback)

**Challenges:**
- PAID agent supports multiple providers (OpenAI, Claude, Ollama)
- Pipeline currently hardcoded to Ollama
- Need to abstract model calls to work with any provider
- Different providers have different APIs and response formats

---

### 2. Refactoring Integration
**What:** Integrated pipeline into code refactoring

**FREE Agent Files Modified:**
- `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/agents/code-refactor.ts`
  - Replaced `validateAndRefine()` with `iterateTask()`
  - Now uses same quality gates as code generation
  - Extracts changes from pipeline verdict's fix_plan

**PAID Agent Files to Modify:**
- `packages/paid-agent-mcp/src/agents/code-refactor.ts` (or equivalent)
- Same provider-agnostic challenges as code generation

---

### 3. Parameter Tuning
**What:** Tuned pipeline parameters for better success rate

**FREE Agent Changes:**
- `maxAttempts`: 3 → 5
- `acceptThreshold`: 0.85 → 0.70
- `minCoverage`: 75% → 70%
- Model: `qwen2.5:3b` → `qwen2.5-coder:7b`
- Timeouts: Increased for larger model

**PAID Agent Considerations:**
- Different models have different capabilities
- OpenAI models may need different thresholds than Claude
- May need model-specific parameter sets
- Cost considerations (more attempts = higher cost)

---

### 4. Old Code Removal
**What:** Removed broken regex-based validation

**FREE Agent Files Deleted:**
- `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/utils/validation.ts` (262 lines)
- `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/utils/refinement.ts` (237 lines)

**FREE Agent Files Created:**
- `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/types/validation.ts` (types only)

**PAID Agent Files to Check:**
- Does PAID agent have similar validation.ts or refinement.ts?
- If yes, delete and replace with types-only file
- Update imports accordingly

---

## 🔧 Implementation Strategy for PAID Agent

### Phase 1: Create Provider-Agnostic Pipeline
**Goal:** Make pipeline work with OpenAI, Claude, and Ollama

**New Files to Create:**
```
packages/paid-agent-mcp/src/pipeline/
├── types.ts              (same as FREE agent)
├── sandbox.ts            (same as FREE agent)
├── synthesize.ts         (provider-agnostic)
├── judge.ts              (provider-agnostic)
├── refine.ts             (provider-agnostic)
└── index.ts              (main orchestrator)
```

**Key Changes:**
- Abstract model calls behind interface:
  ```typescript
  interface ModelProvider {
    generate(prompt: string, options: GenerateOptions): Promise<string>;
  }

  class OpenAIProvider implements ModelProvider { ... }
  class ClaudeProvider implements ModelProvider { ... }
  class OllamaProvider implements ModelProvider { ... }
  ```

- Pipeline accepts provider as parameter:
  ```typescript
  async function iterateTask(
    spec: string,
    config: PipelineConfig,
    provider: ModelProvider  // NEW
  ): Promise<PipelineResult>
  ```

---

### Phase 2: Integrate into PAID Agent
**Goal:** Replace old validation with new pipeline

**Files to Modify:**
1. `packages/paid-agent-mcp/src/agents/code-generator.ts`
   - Import `iterateTask` and provider classes
   - Replace direct API calls with pipeline
   - Configure provider based on user's model choice

2. `packages/paid-agent-mcp/src/agents/code-refactor.ts`
   - Same as code-generator.ts

3. Update imports to use `../types/validation.ts`

---

### Phase 3: Parameter Tuning
**Goal:** Find optimal parameters for each provider

**Model-Specific Parameters:**
```typescript
const PROVIDER_CONFIGS = {
  'gpt-4o-mini': {
    maxAttempts: 3,        // Cheaper, fewer attempts
    acceptThreshold: 0.75, // Higher quality expected
    minCoverage: 75,
  },
  'gpt-4o': {
    maxAttempts: 2,        // Expensive, fewer attempts
    acceptThreshold: 0.80, // Very high quality expected
    minCoverage: 80,
  },
  'claude-sonnet': {
    maxAttempts: 3,
    acceptThreshold: 0.75,
    minCoverage: 75,
  },
  'ollama': {
    maxAttempts: 5,        // Free, more attempts OK
    acceptThreshold: 0.70, // Lower quality expected
    minCoverage: 70,
  },
};
```

---

### Phase 4: Testing
**Goal:** Verify PAID agent works with all providers

**Test Cases:**
1. OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini) - Simple function
2. OpenAI (gpt-4o) - Complex algorithm
3. Claude (sonnet) - React component
4. Ollama (fallback) - Data processing

**Success Criteria:**
- No fake APIs generated
- Code compiles and runs
- Tests pass
- Quality scores meet thresholds

---

## 🆕 NEW: Timeout & Fallback Strategy (To Be Replicated)

### 5. Increased Timeouts
**What:** Increased timeouts to handle larger models and cold starts

**FREE Agent Changes:**
- `synthesize.ts`: 90s → 300s (5 minutes)
- `judge.ts`: 45s → 120s (2 minutes)
- `refine.ts`: 45s → 120s (2 minutes)

**PAID Agent Considerations:**
- OpenAI/Claude don't have cold start issues
- May need shorter timeouts (30-60s)
- Different timeout per provider/model

---

### 6. Fallback to Smaller Model
**What:** Automatically fall back to smaller model if primary times out

**FREE Agent Implementation:**
```typescript
// Try primary model (qwen2.5-coder:7b)
try {
  const response = await ollamaGenerate({ model: 'qwen2.5-coder:7b', ... });
} catch (error) {
  // Fallback to smaller model (qwen2.5:3b)
  const response = await ollamaGenerate({ model: 'qwen2.5:3b', ... });
}
```

**PAID Agent Considerations:**
- Fallback chain: gpt-4o → gpt-4o-mini → ollama
- Or: claude-sonnet → claude-haiku → ollama
- Cost-aware fallback (cheaper models on retry)
- Track fallback usage for optimization

---

### 7. Model Warmup Strategy
**What:** Pre-load models on startup to avoid cold start delays

**FREE Agent Files Created:**
- `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/utils/model-warmup.ts`
  - `warmupModels()` - Warm up multiple models
  - `warmupModel()` - Warm up single model
  - `isModelAvailable()` - Check if model exists
  - `warmupAvailableModels()` - Auto-detect and warm up

**FREE Agent Integration:**
- `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/index.ts`
  - Calls `warmupAvailableModels()` on startup
  - Non-blocking (doesn't delay server start)
  - Logs warmup progress

**PAID Agent Considerations:**
- OpenAI/Claude don't need warmup (cloud-based)
- Only warm up Ollama models (fallback)
- Could pre-fetch API keys/validate credentials on startup

---

**Solution:**
- Fewer maxAttempts for expensive models
- Higher acceptThreshold to reduce iterations
- Cost estimation before running pipeline
- Budget alerts if costs exceed threshold

### 3. Response Format Differences
**Challenge:** Different providers return different JSON structures

**Solution:**
- Normalize responses in provider adapters
- Strict schema validation
- Fallback parsing if JSON is malformed

### 4. Timeout Handling
**Challenge:** Different models have different response times

**Solution:**
- Model-specific timeouts

### What to Do (PAID Agent)

**1. Create Provider-Agnostic Project Brief**
- Same concept, but works for any language/framework
- Support: TypeScript, Python, Go, Java, Rust
- Parse: package.json, pyproject.toml, go.mod, pom.xml, Cargo.toml
- Extract: style rules, layering, testing, glossary, APIs, naming

**2. Integrate into PAID Agent Pipeline**
- Add project brief to synthesize.ts
- Inject "House Rules" into coder prompt
- Force `conventions_used` output
- Cache brief for 5 minutes

**3. Symbol Indexer for Multiple Languages**
- TypeScript/JavaScript: Use TypeScript Compiler API (100% accurate)

## Section 10: Orchestration-Light Design (2025-10-31)

### Overview
Removed autonomous Architect and Orchestrator roles. Human + IDE agent handle design/task selection. Builder agent focuses on contracted implementation with hard quality gates.

### Files Created (4 files, ~600 lines)
1. `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/agents/design-card.ts` (300 lines)
   - Design Card parser (YAML/JSON)
   - Validator with clear error messages
   - Convert Design Card to task spec
   - Find Design Card by slug

2. `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/agents/agent-cli.ts` (250 lines)
   - Thin CLI wrapper (agent run/fix)
   - Loads Design Card
   - Builds project brief
   - Runs quality gates
   - Judge/Fixer loop
   - Writes artifacts (report.json, diffs.patch)

3. `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/agents/.agent/tasks/example-soft-delete.yaml` (40 lines)
   - Example Design Card
   - User soft-delete task
   - Shows all fields (goals, acceptance, constraints, interfaces, dataModel, risks)

4. `.github/workflows/agent-run.yml` (100 lines)
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Triggered by PR label or commit message
   - Runs agent on Design Card
   - Posts results as PR comment

### Key Concepts
- **Design Card**: YAML/JSON specification for tasks (goals, acceptance, constraints, allowedPaths)
- **Thin CLI**: Human-triggered execution (no autonomous orchestrator)
- **Artifact-based reporting**: Write to /artifacts/<slug>/ for review
- **Hard quality gates**: Non-negotiable (build passes, tests pass, coverage ≥80%)

### TODO for PAID Agent
- Implement Design Card parser for PAID agent
- Create thin CLI wrapper for PAID agent
- Integrate with GitHub Actions
- Support multi-provider execution (OpenAI, Claude, Ollama)

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/pipeline/synthesize.ts` - Added project brief, few-shot examples
- `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/pipeline/sandbox.ts` - Added repo tools, edit constraints, convention tests
- `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/pipeline/judge.ts` - Added convention scoring
- `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/pipeline/types.ts` - Added convention score fields

**TODO for PAID Agent:**
- Implement all 10 steps in PAID agent (OpenAI/Claude-compatible versions)
- Adapt pipeline for multi-provider support (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- Test with complex tasks requiring reasoning beyond Ollama's capabilities

## Section 9: Additional Improvements (2025-10-31)

### Overview
Additional improvements based on user feedback to enhance code quality and build performance.

### Files Created (3 files, ~700 lines)
1. `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/utils/diff-generator.ts` (300 lines)
   - Generate unified diffs between file versions
   - Compute line-by-line changes using LCS algorithm
   - Format diffs for LLM prompts
   - Apply and validate diffs

2. `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/utils/dependency-cache.ts` (250 lines)
   - Cache node_modules between sandbox runs
   - Generate cache keys from package.json
   - Symlink or copy cached dependencies
   - Clean old cache entries (keep last 10)
   - Get cache statistics

### Files Modified (3 files)
1. `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/pipeline/judge.ts`
   - Pass FULL error logs (not just first 3-5)
   - Expanded error sections with all lint, type, boundary, custom rule, test, and security errors

2. `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/pipeline/refine.ts`
   - Added diff-based refinement
   - Pass git diff instead of full files when available
   - Show only minimal areas that need fixing
   - Pass full error logs (not truncated)

3. `packages/free-agent-mcp/src/pipeline/sandbox.ts`
   - Integrated dependency caching
   - Install dependencies once, reuse across runs
   - Speeds up builds significantly (no npm install every time)

### Key Improvements
1. **Full Error Feedback**: Judge and Refiner now receive complete error logs, not truncated
2. **Diff-Based Refinement**: Refiner sees git diff instead of full files, keeps style intact
3. **Dependency Caching**: node_modules cached and reused, speeds up builds 10x+
4. **Minimal Edits**: Refiner focuses only on areas marked by errors

### TODO for PAID Agent
- Adapt diff-based refinement for multi-provider support
- Implement dependency caching for PAID agent sandboxes
- Pass full error logs to PAID agent judge/refiner
