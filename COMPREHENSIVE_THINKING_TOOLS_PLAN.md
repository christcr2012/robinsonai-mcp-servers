# Comprehensive Thinking Tools MCP - Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Goal

Create a 6th MCP server with 15+ cognitive frameworks to enhance reasoning across all AI agents.

**Why 6 servers is safe:**
- ✅ Problems started at **9 servers**
- ✅ Unusable at **12 servers**
- ✅ **6 servers = totally fine**

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Tool Structure

Each tool follows this pattern:

```typescript
interface ThinkingToolInput {
  context: string;           // What you're thinking about
  goal?: string;             // What you want to achieve
  constraints?: string[];    // Limitations to consider
  depth?: 'quick' | 'deep';  // How thorough
}

interface ThinkingToolOutput {
  insights: string[];        // Key findings
  recommendations: string[]; // Suggested actions
  warnings?: string[];       // Potential issues
  confidence: number;        // 0-1 confidence score
  reasoning: string;         // How we got here
}
```

### Example: Devil's Advocate

```typescript
{
  "tool": "devils_advocate",
  "arguments": {
    "context": "Plan to migrate from REST to GraphQL",
    "goal": "Find potential problems with this migration",
    "depth": "deep"
  }
}

// Returns:
{
  "insights": [
    "Team has no GraphQL experience - steep learning curve",
    "Existing REST clients will break - need versioning strategy",
    "GraphQL adds complexity - may not be worth it for simple CRUD"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Start with hybrid approach - add GraphQL alongside REST",
    "Train team on GraphQL before migration",
    "Evaluate if GraphQL solves actual problems"
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Migration could take 6+ months",
    "May introduce performance issues if not optimized"
  ],
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Based on common GraphQL migration challenges..."
}
```

## 🤖 Integration with AI Agents

### 1. Architect MCP (Strategic Planning)

**Auto-use thinking tools during planning:**

```typescript
// When creating a plan:
1. Use first_principles to break down the goal
2. Use parallel_thinking to explore multiple approaches
3. Use devils_advocate to challenge each approach
4. Use premortem_analysis to identify risks
5. Use swot_analysis for architecture review
6. Use red_team_thinking to find security issues
```

**Example workflow:**
```
User: "Plan a user authentication system"

Architect internally:
1. first_principles → "Auth = identity + verification + session"
2. parallel_thinking → "Approach A: JWT, Approach B: Sessions, Approach C: OAuth"
3. devils_advocate → "JWT: token theft risk, Sessions: scalability issues, OAuth: complexity"
4. premortem_analysis → "What if tokens leak? What if session store fails?"
5. swot_analysis → Evaluates each approach
6. Final plan → Hybrid approach with best of all
```

### 2. Autonomous Agent MCP (Code Generation)

**Use thinking tools for better code:**

```typescript
// When generating code:
1. Use first_principles to understand the problem
2. Use lateral_thinking for creative solutions
3. Use critical_thinking to evaluate approaches
```

**Example:**
```
User: "Generate a caching layer"

Autonomous Agent internally:
1. first_principles → "Cache = fast storage + invalidation + consistency"
2. lateral_thinking → "What if we use Redis? What if we use in-memory? What if we use CDN?"
3. critical_thinking → "Redis: network overhead, In-memory: limited size, CDN: only for static"
4. Generates optimal solution based on analysis
```

### 3. Credit Optimizer MCP (Workflow Execution)

**Use thinking tools for workflow planning:**

```typescript
// Before executing workflow:
1. Use root_cause_analysis to understand why workflow is needed
2. Use decision_matrix to choose best execution strategy
3. Use premortem_analysis to identify failure points
```

### Dependencies:
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` - MCP framework
- No LLM needed - uses rule-based reasoning frameworks

---

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### For You (User):
```
You: "Use devil's advocate to challenge my plan to rewrite the app in Rust"

Augment: *calls thinking-tools.devils_advocate*
Result: "Challenges: Team doesn't know Rust, ecosystem is smaller, 
         migration would take 6 months, current TypeScript works fine..."
```

### For Augment (Automatic):
```
You: "Plan a new feature"

Augment internally:
1. Calls architect.plan_work()
2. Architect internally calls thinking-tools.first_principles
3. Architect internally calls thinking-tools.devils_advocate
4. Architect internally calls thinking-tools.premortem_analysis
5. Returns comprehensive plan with all thinking applied
```

---

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Better Plans** - Architect uses adversarial thinking to find flaws
2. **Better Code** - Autonomous Agent uses first principles
3. **Better Decisions** - All agents use structured reasoning
4. **Explicit Reasoning** - You can see HOW decisions were made
5. **Reusable** - All agents share the same thinking tools

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Build thinking-tools-mcp package** (~4 hours)
2. **Integrate into Architect** (~2 hours)
3. **Integrate into Autonomous Agent** (~1 hour)
4. **Test 6-server config** (~30 minutes)
5. **Document usage patterns** (~1 hour)

**Total time: ~8-9 hours of work**

## 📝 Open Questions

1. Should thinking tools use local LLM (Ollama) or be rule-based?
   - **Recommendation**: Start rule-based, add LLM later for complex reasoning
   
2. Should thinking tools be exposed to you directly or only used internally by agents?
   - **Recommendation**: Both - you can call them directly OR agents use them automatically

3. Should we add more specialized tools (e.g., cost-benefit analysis, risk matrix)?
   - **Recommendation**: Start with 18 tools, add more based on usage

**Ready to build this! Should I start with Phase 1?**
