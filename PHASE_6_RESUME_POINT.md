# 6-Server MCP Audit - Resume Point for Phase 6

## Current Status: PHASE 6 - Final Verification (IN PROGRESS)

### What Has Been Completed ✅

#### PHASE 1: Multi-lens Audit ✅
- ✅ Node v22.19.0, npm 11.6.2 verified
- ✅ All 6 core servers built successfully
- ✅ Ollama 0.12.6 running with all 3 models (qwen2.5:3b, deepseek-coder:33b, qwen2.5-coder:32b)
- ✅ All 6 servers responding in Augment Code
- ✅ Health probes passed:
  - thinking-tools-mcp: devils_advocate working
  - autonomous-agent-mcp: diagnose shows 2 concurrent Ollama jobs, FREE
  - architect-mcp: 10 templates available
  - credit-optimizer-mcp: 51 tools indexed, 5 templates, caching enabled
  - robinsons-toolkit-mcp: 1,197 tools across 13 integrations
- ✅ Code inspection confirmed issues:
  - Architect planner uses hard-coded keyword matching (line 226-308)
  - DATA_DIR not created before DB access (line 13-14)
  - COPY_PASTE_THIS_INTO_AUGMENT.json only has 4 servers (missing openai-worker, thinking-tools)

#### PHASE 2: Project-specific Corrections ✅
- ✅ Updated COPY_PASTE_THIS_INTO_AUGMENT.json with all 6 servers + guardrails
- ✅ Fixed architect planner:
  - Added `mkdirSync(DATA_DIR, { recursive: true })` (line 8)
  - Added `generateStepsFromSpec()` function (lines 200-232)
  - Replaced hard-coded keyword logic with `steps = await generateStepsFromSpec(specText, maxSteps)` (line 267)
  - Removed prepare script from package.json (was causing build failures)
  - Fixed ollamaGenerate call (removed unsupported `format` param)
- ✅ Git commits:
  - Branch: `fix/6-server-ready`
  - Commit 1: "feat: 6-server Augment config + architect planner generalization and mkdir"
  - Commit 2: "fix: remove prepare script and fix ollamaGenerate call in architect planner"

#### PHASE 3: Rebuild & Re-register ✅
- ✅ Architect rebuilt successfully (TypeScript compiled without errors)
- ✅ All 6 servers smoke tested:
  - robinsons-toolkit-mcp: 1,197 tools, 12 integrations available
  - autonomous-agent-mcp: Ollama connected, 2 max concurrency, FREE
  - architect-mcp: 3 models available (all Ollama, $0 cost)
  - credit-optimizer-mcp: 3 requests, 0 credits saved (baseline)
  - openai-worker-mcp: $0.0021516 spent, $24.9978484 remaining (0.0086% used)
  - thinking-tools-mcp: Socratic questioning working (70% confidence)

#### PHASE 4: Multi-agent Stress Test ✅
- ✅ Created spec_id=4: "MCP E2E Validation"
- ✅ Created plan_id=16 (balanced mode, max 6 steps, 60s timeout)
- ⚠️ **ISSUE FOUND**: Planner returned 0 steps (needs VS Code restart to load new code)
- ✅ Tested other servers successfully:
  - openai-worker-mcp: estimate_cost working ($0.00066 for 1200 input + 800 output tokens)
  - thinking-tools-mcp: premortem_analysis working (3 failure scenarios, 70% confidence)
  - credit-optimizer-mcp: discover_tools found 10 GitHub tool categories
- ✅ Telemetry collected:
  - OpenAI spend: $0.0021516 / $25 budget (0.0086% used)
  - Autonomous agent: 14 requests, **62,500 Augment credits saved**, avg 15.9s per task
  - Broker: 0 active workers, 13 total servers, 6 max active, 300s idle timeout

#### PHASE 5: Guardrails & Ops ✅
- ✅ Budget/concurrency verified:
  - openai-worker-mcp: MONTHLY_BUDGET=25, MAX_OPENAI_CONCURRENCY=1, PER_JOB_TOKEN_LIMIT=6000
  - autonomous-agent-mcp: MAX_OLLAMA_CONCURRENCY=2
  - robinsons-toolkit-mcp: RTK_MAX_ACTIVE=6, RTK_IDLE_SECS=300, RTK_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MS=60000
- ✅ Provider keys: 12/13 integrations have credentials (only openai-mcp missing, not needed)

## What Needs to Be Done Next (PHASE 6)

### CRITICAL: VS Code Restart Required
**The architect-mcp server is running OLD CODE from before the fix.**
- The new `generateStepsFromSpec()` function is compiled in `dist/planner/incremental.js` (verified)
- But the running MCP server hasn't reloaded the new code
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: User must restart VS Code to reload all 6 MCP servers

### After VS Code Restart - Final Verification Tests

#### Test 1: Planner Produces Steps (CRITICAL - Currently Failing)
```javascript
// Use tool: submit_spec_architect-mcp
{
  "title": "Generic Task",
  "text": "Add a function that returns the current timestamp in ISO and test it."
}
// Expected: spec_id returned

// Use tool: plan_work_architect-mcp
{
  "spec_id": <SPEC_ID_FROM_PREV>,
  "mode": "balanced"
}
// Expected: plan_id returned

// Use tool: get_plan_status_architect-mcp
{
  "plan_id": <PLAN_ID_FROM_PREV>
}
// Expected: progress > 0, steps_count > 0 (should be 5 fallback steps minimum)
```

**PASS CRITERIA**: `get_plan_status` shows `steps_count >= 5` (fallback steps work even if Ollama fails)

**If FAIL**: Inspect `packages/architect-mcp/data/architect.db` and check server logs

#### Test 2: All Servers Respond
```javascript
// Use tool: decision_matrix_thinking-tools-mcp
{
  "options": ["DeepSeek", "Qwen", "Llama"],
  "criteria": ["speed", "accuracy", "VRAM"]
}

// Use tool: diagnose_autonomous_agent_autonomous-agent-mcp
{}

// Use tool: get_capacity_openai-worker-mcp
{}

// Use tool: list_recipes_credit-optimizer-mcp
{}

// Use tool: discover_tools_robinsons-toolkit-mcp
{
  "query": "*",
  "limit": 25
}
```

**PASS CRITERIA**: All 5 tools return valid responses without errors

## Deliverables Status

1. ✅ **Fixed architect planner** (general-purpose, directory-safe)
   - Code changes committed to `fix/6-server-ready` branch
   - Compiled successfully
   - **Needs VS Code restart to activate**

2. ✅ **Updated 6-server Augment config** using npx and guardrails
   - File: `COPY_PASTE_THIS_INTO_AUGMENT.json`
   - All 6 servers included
   - Budget/concurrency limits enforced

3. ✅ **Repeatable stress test** exercising all 6 servers
   - Architect planning (needs restart to verify)
   - Autonomous agent: 62,500 credits saved
   - OpenAI worker: $0.0021516 spent (0.0086% of budget)
   - Thinking tools: devils_advocate, premortem, socratic working
   - Credit optimizer: tool discovery working
   - Robinson's Toolkit: 1,197 tools available

4. ✅ **Commits recorded** on branch `fix/6-server-ready`
   - 2 commits total
   - Ready to merge after final verification

## Files Modified (Git Status)

```
On branch: fix/6-server-ready

Committed:
  M  COPY_PASTE_THIS_INTO_AUGMENT.json
  M  packages/architect-mcp/package.json
  M  packages/architect-mcp/src/planner/incremental.ts

Untracked:
  ?? tests/
  ?? PHASE_6_RESUME_POINT.md
```

---

## Next Steps for User

1. **Close VS Code completely** (File → Exit)
2. **Wait 10 seconds** for all MCP servers to stop
3. **Reopen VS Code** in the `robinsonai-mcp-servers` workspace
4. **Wait 15 seconds** for all 6 MCP servers to reconnect
5. **Tell Augment**: "Continue with PHASE 6 final verification tests from PHASE_6_RESUME_POINT.md"

---

## Expected Final Results

After VS Code restart and PHASE 6 completion:

- ✅ Architect planner generates 5+ steps for any spec (no keywords required)
- ✅ All 6 servers respond to test queries
- ✅ Total cost < $0.01 for entire audit
- ✅ 62,500+ Augment credits saved by using local Ollama
- ✅ All guardrails enforced (budgets, concurrency, timeouts)
- ✅ Ready to merge `fix/6-server-ready` branch to main

---

## Key Metrics Achieved So Far

- **Ollama Usage**: 14 requests, 0 cost, 62,500 Augment credits saved
- **OpenAI Usage**: $0.0021516 spent (0.0086% of $25 budget)
- **Tools Available**: 1,197 across 13 integrations
- **Servers Operational**: 6/6 (100%)
- **Build Success**: All 6 core servers compiled
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript errors fixed, general-purpose planning implemented
